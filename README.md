## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data fetching, preprocessing, and analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for visualiation and exploration.
- `outputs/`: Generated outputs such as visualiations and summary files.

## Steps
1. Run `scripts/fetch_swapi_data.py` to fetch data from the SWAPI API.
2. Run `scripts/preprocess_scripts.py` to process movie scripts.
3. Run `scripts/analysis.py` to calculate insights.
4. Use `notebooks/` for visualisation.
